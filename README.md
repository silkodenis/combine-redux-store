# Combine Redux Store

Combine Redux Store is a lightweight package for state management in SwiftUI and Combine applications, built on unidirectional data flow (UDF) architectures. It provides a unified state management mechanism along with support for state-driven asynchronous side effects.

## Key Features

- **State Management:** Utilizes a unified model for state and actions similar to Redux.
- **Asynchronous Effects:** Supports state-driven asynchronous side-effects via Feedback mechanisms, ensuring that effects are triggered based on state changes.
- **Combine Support:** Leverages powerful data stream handling and reactive programming with Combine.

## Installation
